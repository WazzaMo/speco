# Speco

A research project to use markdown spec files as input to AI agents
for safe and auditable AI-accelerated development.

**EXPERIMENTAL**

## Hypothesis

Using a deliberate method of writing specifications for code, unit test specifications and integration test specifications, AI agents can be prompted from these checked-in project files, leading to code generation via AI that can be repeated and improved upon.

## Processes to develop

1. system composition from multiple specs

2. Developing or evolving components over time, through spec increments or modifications.
